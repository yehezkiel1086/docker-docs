# Mandatory Exercise 1.12: Hello, frontend!

A good developer creates well-written READMEs. Such that they can be used to create Dockerfiles with ease.

Clone, fork or download the project from https://github.com/docker-hy/material-applications/tree/main/example-frontend.

Create a Dockerfile for the project (example-frontend) and give a command so that the project runs in a Docker container with port 5000 exposed and published so when you start the container and navigate to http://localhost:5000 you will see message if you're successful.

- note that the port 5000 is reserved in the more recent OSX versions (Monterey, Big Sur), so you have to use some other host port

Submit the Dockerfile.

*As in other exercises, do not alter the code of the project*

TIPS:

- The project has install instructions in README.
- Note that the app starts to accept connections when "Accepting connections at http://localhost:5000" has been printed to the screen, this takes a few seconds
- You do not have to install anything new outside containers.
- The project might not work with too new Node.js versions
