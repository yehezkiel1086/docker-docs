# Exercise 1.7: Image for script

We can improve our previous solutions now that we know how to create and build a Dockerfile.

Let us now get back to Exercise 1.4.

Create a new file `script.sh` on your local machine with the following contents:

```sh
while true
do
  echo "Input website:"
  read website; echo "Searching.."
  sleep 1; curl http://$website
done
```

Create a Dockerfile for a new image that starts from *ubuntu:22.04* and add instructions to install curl into that image. Then add instructions to copy the script file into that image and finally set it to run on container start using CMD.

After you have filled the Dockerfile, build the image with the name "curler".

- If you are getting permission denied, use `chmod` to give permission to run the script.

The following should now work:

```sh
$ docker run -it curler

  Input website:
  helsinki.fi
  Searching..
  <!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC "-//IETF//DTD HTML 2.0//EN">
  <html><head>
  <title>301 Moved Permanently</title>
  </head><body>
  <h1>Moved Permanently</h1>
  <p>The document has moved <a href="https://www.helsinki.fi/">here</a>.</p>
  </body></html>
```

Remember that RUN can be used to execute commands while building the image!

Submit the Dockerfile.
