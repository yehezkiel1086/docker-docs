# Exercise 2.2

Read about how to add the command to docker-compose.yml from the documentation.

The familiar image `devopsdockeruh/simple-web-service` can be used to start a web service, see the exercise 1.10.

Create a docker-compose.yml, and use it to start the service so that you can use it with your browser.

Submit the docker-compose.yml, and make sure that it works simply by running `docker compose up`
