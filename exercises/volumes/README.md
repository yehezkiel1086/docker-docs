# Exercise 1.9: Volumes

In this exercise we won't create a new Dockerfile.

Image `devopsdockeruh/simple-web-service` creates a timestamp every two seconds to `/usr/src/app/text.log` when it's not given a command. Start the container with a bind mount so that the logs are created into your filesystem.

Submit the command you used to complete the exercise.

**Hint**: read the note that was made just before this exercise!
